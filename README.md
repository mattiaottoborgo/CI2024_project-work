# CI2024_project-work
The project has been developed in collaboration with Federico Fortunati and Yuri Pettorossi.
## Introduction
The aim of the project is the development of a Genetic Programming algorithm applied for the Symbolic Regression problem.
A selection of 8 problems as been provided. For each of them, the algorithm as been run up to 2000 generations.
Below you can find the main characteristics.
## Operators
The following is the list of operators we implemented in our algorithm:

## Mutations
We implemeneted the following list of mutation functions:
Method_name:explanation;
## Crossover
We implemented the following list of crossover functions:
Method_name:explanation;
## Selection
Talk about tournament selection and how you applied.

## Results
The following is the MSE obtained for each problem

## Final considerations
Talk about challenges such as tree growing,validation of operations (division by zero, negative logs ), balance between exploration and exploitation and diversity.
Further improvements can rely in the generation of initial candidates, penalty for long solutions and additional diversity functions.
